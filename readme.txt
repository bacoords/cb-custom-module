* Spotlight - Create your own list of custom links on one side that each replaces the 'spotlight' photo on the other. Customize column sizes and more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I install this plugin without Beaver Builder? =

Yes, but it won't do anything. This plugin is an extension to [Beaver Builder](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/).

= What about browsers? =

CB Custom Modules uses some modern CSS specs like Flexbox and animations. Modules will all work, but with older versions of IE you might see a less-refined version. 

= Are these modules responsive? =

Yes. Some modules maintain their same behavior on mobile, but modules that rely on hover effects provide an experience tailored to touch screens.

= Is this plugin open source? =

[Yes](https://github.com/bacoords/cb-custom-modules). Feel free to use and adapt as needed. Or reach out to me with any feature requests.
